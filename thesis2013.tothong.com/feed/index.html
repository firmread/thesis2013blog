				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This midterm presentation really makes me nervous since it is a first time to get a formal critique from professors that is absolutely outside the game design part of our program. On the other hand, because both Ed and Ted had never known about our project at all, it is a really good chance to get critics from someone that really ‘outside’ of the circle and have fresh eyes on the project.</p>
<p>In this presentation is pretty much where we concluded our thought from our common inspirations from game, interaction and art that spark our collaboration last semester to the current technical struggles that we are facing which is, ironically, also inspired us on narrative and aesthetics side of the project.</p>
<p>We decided on the title of the game as ‘that they’. Knowing that this name is strange and might sound grammatically wrong, and Paul even had a hard time to pronounce the word. However, the fact that it derived from Dewey’s claim on aesthetic that it related only to experiences significant to people’s memories: “that meal, that storm, that rupture of friendship.” It reflects perfectly with our struggle on coding side. As we were trying to utilize object-oriented concept from C++ to create a generic conceptual object that would eventually grows into many specific version with the method called inheritance.</p>
<p>Even though the playable prototype we had in the presentation was pretty much still broken and still using those placeholder geometrics, the graphical assets for the project had a lot of progress.</p>
<p>Ted had a really great feedback comparing our intention on making a local multiplayer game with an Ouija board. Which started as a normal board game but had eventually spiritualized in many culture.  Everyone seems like to have a control over it and at the same time have no control at all. That strange relationship that formed between the player by the game that strong enough to be interpret as if it that allows a spirit had intervene that play. It is this kind of ritualized aspect of board game where we think of it as a main inspiration: the box that contains beautiful objects and specific rules of how this little world moves. On the other side, Ouija also nicely reflects our inspiration from art world like concept of relational object or social sculpture. It feels like Ted had put a crucial puzzle piece into our list of inspirations where everything connects together.  We are absolutely grateful to have him as our critic. During spring break week we even made a few mini-game prototype that utilized the concept of hold on something together into a game already. It might easily grow into a main theme and interaction of this game. However, that still yet to decide, we would prefer leaving some rooms for playtest feedback from the class before nail down this point.</p>
<p>On the other hand, interactive narrative side is where we absolutely still shorts of a real work in this presentation. What we presented is more like a proposal, a break down of structure that we would like to incorporate but most real works had yet to be done. So it is really hard to criticize on anything. Ted did mentioned about how everything seems to be nice but still lacks of many crucial elements.</p>
<p>However, Ed gave us many good references that would push our interactive narrative side further. One of the references that he highly recommended is to read annotation version of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, as these two books are mirror world of each other and our game is, in many sense, also a mirror world.</p>
<p>I spent most of the night after the critique reading the Wikipedia page of both book. While not the best way to enjoy this great timeless fiction, but to read a full version of the book is literally jumping into a rabbit hole which we was pretty much been doing with code since this semester started. Even on Wikipedia page is just a series of stripped down facts of the book, I really enjoyed reading it. As I had saw so many movies and games that had a narrative reference to this story when I was young and had never fully understand it. Now that I know more of art history and coding skills, knowing that the author of the books, Lewis Carroll is also a mathematician and those weird concepts and dialogs in many scenes are expressing his mathematical though. I feel a strong connection to what we are doing here with our thesis as we both been making projects that had highly inspired by Zach Lieberman’s code in classes that we took with him. Those inspirations even flow over into narrative and side of the game.</p>
<p>I also love the story behind the novel itself, as Lewis Carroll started writing the book after he row a boat with his friend and three little daughters of his friend. It was just the kind of story non-sense story where he naturally improvise the narrative on anything he saw to make the girls enjoyed the moment. He might also have unconsciously express some mathematical concept into that story. When Alice asked him to write the book for her, he just can’t help falling in love with that fantasy world he had created and ended up expand it into a novel. This story also draws a lot of connection to our project, as Paul was started as an autobiography game and when we collaborated the theme had shifted into more fantasy, dreamscape like. With the fact that Paul’s now six-month old little daughter, Brady is so cute and growing up day by day. She is trying to speak and making weird sounds. So when I stayed over Paul’s place over spring break Paul’s small apartment always have a sound of Chinese kid’s songs sang by a family member and a murmuring Brady sounds trying to speak or sing back the same song. A girl’s mind might be the best inspiration for guys who keep thinking about the complex mathematical concept, no matter if it’s 19<sup>th</sup> century or 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>Ted and Ed also had given us a numerous list of reference on game, films, and animation that we should watch or play. While those are very helpful and expands our thought as we play or watch them. I might need a bit more time to digest them to be able to elaborate on how those game might draw a connection to our game in future paper. For now, Ouija and Alice’s mirror world had strongly resonated the essence of our game. Hopefully, its finally time for this conceptual side of this project with melt away its rock candy and only diamonds would remain while we busy making it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week, we finally get to the point where we realized that the base world logic doesn’t work, or at least, we won’t get it to works anytime soon.</p>
<p>With concept of inheritance, we were trying to make the game of two worlds by make one finished base world with all interactions and duplicate that into two worlds. While sounds logical, it is really hard to think more of core mechanic while coding it because most of the meaningful interactions are situated in between of two worlds.</p>
<p>To focus on that core between two players, we start to code things from ground up again. Even though sounds like a wasted of time, but this is where we realized how much we learned in a process of iterating on coding logic. We got much more refined code and interaction out of this. The best way to work is to sit next to each other and look at a core problem together and split smaller not important stuffs to each other. It is not that Github workflow is not working, but because of our inexperience in working with code collaboratively is still a thing that we have to get over. Github might be very useful in a future iteration or professional works but, for now, sitting together is the best way to work.</p>
<p>We realized that we started to fall behind the schedule a lot, but core mechanic in new version of code that we are building is the most refined so far. With our experiments of various tools such as Zach Gage’s OpenFrameworks addon that provided a sprite sheet system for 2d game, could be very helpful moving forward.</p>
<p>We also settled down with the name of the game in this week. thatThey derived it name from Dewey’s claim on aesthetic that it is related only to experiences significant to people’s memories: “that meal, that storm, that rupture of friendship.”</p>
<p>We love how it reflects a very thoughtful angle on memories and aesthetic. Which also juxtaposed nicely with the concept of inheritance that we have been dealing with in code in past weeks. In code, we would build a base object with vague explanation and function like a character, a world, an item, etc. and then would make a variation of those in a very specific one, such as that character, that world, that item.  I found this is beautiful resonance between the two processes and totally should go into the game itself. The aesthetic goal of this game narrative would look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-9.28.47-PM.png"><img class="wp-image-384 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-13 at 9.28.47 PM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-9.28.47-PM-1024x261.png" width="458" height="117" /></a></p>
<p>We also like how the name homophone with the word ‘that day’ that suggested directly to the past. Also when I searched on Google with the name, the first thing it found is this phrase from the bible:</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-9.37.19-PM.png"><img class="wp-image-385 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-13 at 9.37.19 PM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-9.37.19-PM-1024x177.png" width="430" height="74" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-9.37.19-PM-1024x177.png 1024w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-9.37.19-PM.png 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is resonating perfectly with the aesthetic goals we want to achieve in this game: to realized at the end, that they all may be one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we focused on how narrative layers intersect with level design by focusing on non-player characters that will appear in game, and how the story should progress.</p>
<p>The idea is the world inside thatThey is a dreamscape. Memories are misplaced, some are lost, and some are exaggerated. The character such as dog, birds, or rabbit can be a representation of friends inside the classroom and the boss of the game, dog’s mother; can be an angry parent of a bullyboy that represented as a dog.  Birds are like a bunch of smaller bullies these kids have to face. It is hard even just to hold on to oneself under this kind of situation but in some situation someone needs to stand up and help those are in needed. The choice would fall to the player if they would want to score on their personal safety or collaboratively protect each other.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From feedbacks from Indiecade folks that resonate with Colleen’s, we started to make a series of paper prototype on a cardboard of iPad size that focused on possible interactions and narrative around rope as a main item of this game. Since we had a specific gesture in mind of how two players should play this game, by holding iPad on each side at the same time, we came up with these series of possible gameplay.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-367 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 3.34.57 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM-1024x673.png" width="430" height="283" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM-300x197.png 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM-1024x673.png 1024w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM.png 1064w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>In these two drawings, we are experimenting with the idea of how to use a rope to trigger a simple puzzle for another player such as triggering a switch or a trap, lifting an obstacle to reveal hidden item or open up the blocked pathway.</p>
<p>The interesting comments we got from this part of the prototype is that it is important to develop a visual language that allow the player to intuitively know how objects in game should be interact with. For example, an obvious and repetitively use of a hook as a visual representation of ‘hook-able’ object.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.36.52-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-370 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 3.36.52 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.36.52-AM.png" width="456" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>On the left picture above is a funky idea on how the idea of using rope-hooking function in a game can be use in even more weird way. In this idea, the players have to roll the iPad in spiral direction in harmony, and keep the accelerometer curser on the rotating mark on the screen to open up a screw cap in side the game world.</p>
<p>On the right picture is another use of rope as a pathway for something to move from one world to another. In this case, water that could be diverts the current into another world through the rope to stop a blocking fire in another player’s world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.38.21-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-371 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 3.38.21 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.38.21-AM.png" width="465" height="203" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.38.21-AM-300x131.png 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.38.21-AM.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></a></p>
<p>These three pictures above is a sequence of one scenario, where one player sends a rope to help another player to get to the other side of an obstacle. This rope-swinging function is very simple but yet we think it is playing with a very nature use of rope physical property and can also be very meaningful interaction and totally should goes into the final game.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.39.36-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-372 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 3.39.36 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.39.36-AM-1024x678.png" width="442" height="293" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.39.36-AM-1024x678.png 1024w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.39.36-AM.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></a></p>
<p>The last set in this paper prototype series is these two pictures where we explore in objects that could interrupt the rope interaction between two players such as a frozen cloud that would make the rope frozen and harder to control, or birds that would cut or block the way for the rope to go on the other side.</p>
<p>We found that the obstacle in the space between the two worlds makes a really interesting interplay with rope interactions and it is also adding very natural, intuitive, and meaningful layers for the vertical space between the two players. thatThey is all about reaching out to help another player. The interruption of that interaction is where we can put challenge into the mix and possibly allow player to achieve flow state in game.</p>
<p>The interesting overall sense of this prototype series is that the sense of side-scrolling platformer game that we had in previous digital prototype that we made in last semester start to dissipated and it’s now seems more focused as a puzzle gameplay in more limited space that is not very different from the size of the screen.</p>
<p>One reason is because of the orientation of the screen that vertical space are more spacious than horizontal space, which is a total opposite from what side-scrolling game normally does. Especially, if you compare it to a simple art game like Passage, which limited the screen size of the game in long horizontal space with a very small vertical. That’s why it is much more intuitive to focus on vertical space and interaction between two players than to go with side scrolling game which player would focused more on what is to come on the left or right of the screen than the interaction from vertical direction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week we started to realize a very complicated design problems in our game concept. Since the game is about two players simultaneously play the game on both side of the iPad. There are so many ways to write this in code.</p>
<p>Zach Lieberman introduced us with the concept of inheritance in C++ in Algorithmic Animation class last semester. It is a very powerful concept in this language that allowed us to create variations of object in the world by start with the base object that with a vague explanation but contains all property needed for the type of the object. There is a saying that the code would get too complex to the point where is human unreadable in lower level, original C at somewhere around 25,000 lines of code. While with this concept of object-oriented language in C++, that point of unreadable would somewhere around 100,000 lines of code.</p>
<p>As we are trying to master this new logic of object-oriented into our project. It is a really hard design question as we trying to make a base game mechanic that would be able to expand into a whole game.</p>
<p>thatThey is really consisted of two worlds, not just in narrative level but also on the coding side. We are using Box2d, physic simulations library for two-dimensional game and in Box2d we have to initiate the object that is called as box2dWorld that would contains universal properties for every objects that is inside that world, such as gravity and damping.</p>
<p>We tried to organize the two-world logic of our game by making an object of one world and then call two of them out in a gameplay so that we can get the two-world game. While theoretically sounds, we found a lot of problem in making this logic comes true because we are also trying to translate the code from our last prototype from last semester into this new foundation that we can use moving further.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we also making sketches for level design. These sketches are heavily inspired by the game ’Guacamelee!’ by DrinkBox Studios that we played together in IndieCade East. Since the game is also two-player collaborative platformer game and we feels good playing it. So we aim to making a similar demo that shows an introductory level of game’s various mechanic and just a small bit if narrative that could potentially expand into a bigger game later.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that we have a lot of unexpected reaction from Colleen and IndieCade East folks that came to our class in the following Tuesday after the event including Rami Ismail, one of the creator of the game Super Crate Box, Fernando Ramallo from Buenos Aires, and Davey Wreden, developer of an interactive narrative game, Stanley Parable. They all have a strong reaction on how our game is going in a wrong direction as we put more ‘stuffs’ into the core mechanic. They provide us with the same suggestions on we should develop on only one strong core mechanic and expand that into a whole game.</p>
<p>While very different from what we thought, we also learnt a lot from a resource that these guys point us to such as Anna Anthropy’s article named: ‘level design lesson: to the right, hold on tight.’ Which explained in detail on the first level of the first Super Mario Bros. in NES about how this level design has become so iconic that it impress the whole generation of the gamer. The article entailed about how good level design can just provide affordance of discovery for the player inside the game without having to provide a traditional tutorial to a player.</p>

<p>The subject explored in more detail in online video show called Sequelitis that talked about the norm in Mega Man and how the first level of Mega Man X a sequel in SNES is designed to inform the player about new system of the game without having to explain any details. Which at the same time, wrap the whole game’s narrative very well in one scene that provides a simple aesthetic goal and motivation for the player that will recur throughout the game: to make Mega Man stronger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Collaboratively working on code is one of the trickiest parts of our workflow.</p>
<p>This week Colleen asked us to make a schedule for the whole semester so that we can keep record and see if we’re on track of making things finished as it meant to be or not.</p>
<p>With these two reasons, I think it crucial for us to use Github as tool that will provide us a environment that let us keep track of both production timeline and versioning of the code. It took a while to setup the repository and list all the production needs into a list for each week. Hopefully, this process will not helpful for the project afterward.</p>
<p>While not widely used as a social network, it is a significant platform that moves the open source community that collaboratively develops emerging frameworks that empowering people all over the world such as OpenFrameworks or NodeJS. Developing literacy for this platform also means that we are preparing ourselves for potential bigger contributions in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-4.29.06-PM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-13 at 4.29.06 PM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-4.29.06-PM-1024x734.png" width="448" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following pictures are part of a film Zach Lieberman showed to us in Audio/Video System class, Neighbours by Norman McLaren. I personally love the aesthetic of old media. It is a stop-motion film that also has a playful sense of animation and talk to more serious relationship between border and neighborhood.</p>
<p>The film started by two neighbors living peacefully in shared space until there is a beautiful flower grown in the middle of their house. After just a few moments of enjoyment that they both shared, they start to fight for ownership over the flower. I like how the story takes us through the worst narrative route you could possibly have in this kind of conflict. Even though it is a linear narrative but its extreme ending encourage the audiences to think about a possible worlds and possible answer for this kind of conflict as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-348" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 2.49.44 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM-1024x214.png" width="478" height="100" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM-1024x214.png 1024w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM.png 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Norman McLaren’s Neighbours (1952)</em></p>
<p> As a tribute, I’m thinking of borrowing a form of houses used in the film to our game because the juxtaposition of two sides is a narrative technique that we will emphasize in our game as well.</p>
<p>In this week, we are also developing a new item that would go into the game, the one that Paul really passionate about, a water gun.</p>
<p>The playable prototype explores common possible events such as bullet/enemy collision detection, bullet-regenerating point, and enemies re spawn. We also discussed on possible controlling scheme for the game, as many people including Colleen tends to have strong opinion on ‘ virtual buttons’ in touchscreen interface as a counter-intuitive control. Zach Gage also mentioned on his talk at GDC last year as a bad scheme that won’t allow the player to achieve flow in the game.</p>
<p>We tested the swiping interaction in the game instead of the use of button but have yet to satisfy with current algorithm that we have, as it have a really buggy movement. Paul suggested that we should go back to buttons scheme, but I’m still thinking that there might be a way to get this interaction right.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-350" alt="watergun2" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg" width="436" height="232" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2-300x160.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></a></p>
<p>We had a chance to play demo of Worm Run, a game by Andy Wallace, alumni of MFADT, during Playtech event in December. In the game, it has a very interesting relationship between the control scheme and aesthetic of the game. As Andy called it as ‘swipe to survive’, in which the player basically swipe in every direction as fast as possible to run away from a giant worm that hunting you for a lunch.</p>
<p>I suspected that different opinions on controlling scheme might means that we also aiming for a slightly different aesthetic goal of a game. However, I think it is a healthy argument and I think we’ll explore more on until we find the right algorithm before really fallback to the button control scheme.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this first week, Colleen had to attended the conference she promised to go. So we had this chance of a week without pressure (well, or just without realizing that pressure). We decided to stay away from code for a bit longer and started to make a boardgame version of our game. Which largely inspired by Lord of The Ring that we played together.</p>
<p><strong>First prototype</strong>, orange pieces are our attempt on exploring terrain system in boardgame version. Blue pieces are challenge system that would trigger by chance. This system is to balance out between time to spend on exploring the terrain also triggering chance of things getting worse. Lastly, green board is main progress board. Each stage can have different progress and goal.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-219" alt="paper prototype 1" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-768x1024.jpg" width="553" height="737" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-225x300.jpg 225w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Second prototype</strong>, we explore more on how terrain can provide both linear narrative and randomness. The orange tiles are randomly place on the fixed terrain of each stage. On each tile is a different kind of stuffs: treasure, adventure, pass, and challenge.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-220" alt="2" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-1024x768.jpg" width="542" height="407" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SCN_0007.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-223" alt="SCN_0007" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SCN_0007-1024x426.jpg" width="574" height="238" /></a> <a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-224" alt="tiletype" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-1024x320.jpg" width="574" height="179" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-300x93.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-1024x320.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Third prototype</strong>, we expanded those idea of each tile type into set of cards (most of them just a placeholder though.) Challenge card is not on terrain anymore but is randomly pick at the beginning of the turn from movement tile. There is a chance to just move normally (-) and facing challenge (x). While adventure, treasure and pass are still on terrain. The terrain are revealed while the player is on adjacent tile. So that the player still have a chance to make a meaningful choice from their line of sight.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-221" alt="3" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Fourth prototype</strong>, we started to go into adventure tile and treasure tile. Some of  adventure tile has a chance of getting treasure but will have to fight against something for example fighting with a monster through simple die roll. While some are just a fight without direct consequence to the main story. On the other hand, treasure cards can be picked right away. And usually required or helpful for clearing adventure card.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/4.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-222" alt="4" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/4-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of the week, we had a brunch and update presentation at d12. John and Colleen stop us very early when we started to explain the detail of rule of card game. It was a really rabbit hole. John quickly suggest that paper prototype is fine, but focus on just one medium. Games are not translate across medium as easy as we thought.</p>
<p>However, it was a great sidetrack. We had a tons of idea for side system and world making of the game. So here we go again, back to the core mechanic, coming up soon!</p>
<p>PS. Ultimate goal of this semester, FIVE STAGES!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The narrative concept for thesis project, an iPad game with working title ‘thatThey’, is inspired by my experience back in Thailand during my undergrad years where I went to rural northern part of Thailand with my faculty’s voluntary camp.</p>
<p>It was a great experience for me. I went to about seven voluntary camps throughout my undergrad years. The goal of the camp is to build a small concrete building for local school that doesn’t have enough funding from government. On the other hand, it also allows student that born and raised in big city like myself to experience life without technologies in those rural areas where the moon is still the brightest source of light at night.</p>
<p>I met Sarun in the last camp I attended.</p>
<p>Here is a translation of the blog post I wrote for Sarun a few months after the camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><i>Original Thai version: </i><a href="http://litchirhythm.multiply.com/journal/item/8/8"><i>http://litchirhythm.multiply.com/journal/item/8/8</i></a><i></i></p>
<p align="right"><b>SAI-YAI  </b>(Thai for: string, relationship)</p>
<p>Theory is<br />
When people start to know each other,<br />
Develop their feeling for each other,<br />
String of our soul,<br />
Also tied to one another’s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back of the truck, that carried about thirty college students back into the city from a small school in a rural uphill.<br />
Picture of Sarun still imprint vividly in the mind of a seventh-time camper,<br />
It was about a year and a half since his last voluntary camp.<br />
This feeling that he once used to, once again, fresh in the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First picture is slowly packing a bag<br />
Fold down a tent house<br />
A small school that we live as if it was our home is now transform back to what it meant to be.<br />
Then we take everything that we brought back, except those that meant to be given, into the truck<br />
Just a few souvenirs in each of our hand,<br />
And memories.<br />
Sarun like to hold my hand<br />
Sarun is the first camp kid that ever draws a picture of him to my notebook<br />
Sarun is the only camp kid that asked me to jump down into a river with him</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day before the last day Sarun didn’t show up at the school<br />
I was worried that we might don’t have a chance to say goodbye</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last morning, Sarun was back and hold my hand again<br />
“Where were you yesterday?”</p>
<p>“I was helping my dad herding”</p>
<p>“Umm”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This second grade boy was much better at digging than some of the second year college student<br />
It wouldn’t surprise me at all if his herding skill is also superior than this fifth year college student too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belongings slowly put into their containers<br />
Trucks came in and take all students and those containers back to the town</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last picture was from the back of the truck with a tensile roof<br />
It covered the truck in the way that make picture of the scenery behind appears to be so bright<br />
Waving hands<br />
All the camp kids were there<br />
And indeed, Sarun too</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck turn around the corner to the main street<br />
Picture of those classrooms vanished from my eyes<br />
A boy then ran out from that corner<br />
And wave his hand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trucks slowly run through a crooked street</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question is: how much distance would it takes before this this string torn apart<br />
I imagined my soul get thinner and thinner as the truck goes on<br />
Strings spun themselves out as the distance increase<br />
And when it ran out of any more soul to spun, it started to stretch like a rubber<br />
And it gets thinner and thinner<br />
Until it torn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be right at that moment that the string that tied us together, is gone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I wake up<br />
As the cloud of dreams dissipated and the sun shine through my window again<br />
I found myself hold on a small string inside my memories<br />
Piece of the story that haven’t been forgotten</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at it, thoroughly, once again<br />
And decided to tell you, this story.</p>
