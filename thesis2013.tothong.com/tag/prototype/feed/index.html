				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From feedbacks from Indiecade folks that resonate with Colleen’s, we started to make a series of paper prototype on a cardboard of iPad size that focused on possible interactions and narrative around rope as a main item of this game. Since we had a specific gesture in mind of how two players should play this game, by holding iPad on each side at the same time, we came up with these series of possible gameplay.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-367 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 3.34.57 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM-1024x673.png" width="430" height="283" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM-300x197.png 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM-1024x673.png 1024w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.34.57-AM.png 1064w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>In these two drawings, we are experimenting with the idea of how to use a rope to trigger a simple puzzle for another player such as triggering a switch or a trap, lifting an obstacle to reveal hidden item or open up the blocked pathway.</p>
<p>The interesting comments we got from this part of the prototype is that it is important to develop a visual language that allow the player to intuitively know how objects in game should be interact with. For example, an obvious and repetitively use of a hook as a visual representation of ‘hook-able’ object.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.36.52-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-370 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 3.36.52 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.36.52-AM.png" width="456" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>On the left picture above is a funky idea on how the idea of using rope-hooking function in a game can be use in even more weird way. In this idea, the players have to roll the iPad in spiral direction in harmony, and keep the accelerometer curser on the rotating mark on the screen to open up a screw cap in side the game world.</p>
<p>On the right picture is another use of rope as a pathway for something to move from one world to another. In this case, water that could be diverts the current into another world through the rope to stop a blocking fire in another player’s world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.38.21-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-371 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 3.38.21 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.38.21-AM.png" width="465" height="203" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.38.21-AM-300x131.png 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.38.21-AM.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" /></a></p>
<p>These three pictures above is a sequence of one scenario, where one player sends a rope to help another player to get to the other side of an obstacle. This rope-swinging function is very simple but yet we think it is playing with a very nature use of rope physical property and can also be very meaningful interaction and totally should goes into the final game.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.39.36-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-372 aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 3.39.36 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.39.36-AM-1024x678.png" width="442" height="293" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.39.36-AM-1024x678.png 1024w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-3.39.36-AM.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></a></p>
<p>The last set in this paper prototype series is these two pictures where we explore in objects that could interrupt the rope interaction between two players such as a frozen cloud that would make the rope frozen and harder to control, or birds that would cut or block the way for the rope to go on the other side.</p>
<p>We found that the obstacle in the space between the two worlds makes a really interesting interplay with rope interactions and it is also adding very natural, intuitive, and meaningful layers for the vertical space between the two players. thatThey is all about reaching out to help another player. The interruption of that interaction is where we can put challenge into the mix and possibly allow player to achieve flow state in game.</p>
<p>The interesting overall sense of this prototype series is that the sense of side-scrolling platformer game that we had in previous digital prototype that we made in last semester start to dissipated and it’s now seems more focused as a puzzle gameplay in more limited space that is not very different from the size of the screen.</p>
<p>One reason is because of the orientation of the screen that vertical space are more spacious than horizontal space, which is a total opposite from what side-scrolling game normally does. Especially, if you compare it to a simple art game like Passage, which limited the screen size of the game in long horizontal space with a very small vertical. That’s why it is much more intuitive to focus on vertical space and interaction between two players than to go with side scrolling game which player would focused more on what is to come on the left or right of the screen than the interaction from vertical direction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Collaboratively working on code is one of the trickiest parts of our workflow.</p>
<p>This week Colleen asked us to make a schedule for the whole semester so that we can keep record and see if we’re on track of making things finished as it meant to be or not.</p>
<p>With these two reasons, I think it crucial for us to use Github as tool that will provide us a environment that let us keep track of both production timeline and versioning of the code. It took a while to setup the repository and list all the production needs into a list for each week. Hopefully, this process will not helpful for the project afterward.</p>
<p>While not widely used as a social network, it is a significant platform that moves the open source community that collaboratively develops emerging frameworks that empowering people all over the world such as OpenFrameworks or NodeJS. Developing literacy for this platform also means that we are preparing ourselves for potential bigger contributions in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-4.29.06-PM.png"><img alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-13 at 4.29.06 PM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-03-13-at-4.29.06-PM-1024x734.png" width="448" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following pictures are part of a film Zach Lieberman showed to us in Audio/Video System class, Neighbours by Norman McLaren. I personally love the aesthetic of old media. It is a stop-motion film that also has a playful sense of animation and talk to more serious relationship between border and neighborhood.</p>
<p>The film started by two neighbors living peacefully in shared space until there is a beautiful flower grown in the middle of their house. After just a few moments of enjoyment that they both shared, they start to fight for ownership over the flower. I like how the story takes us through the worst narrative route you could possibly have in this kind of conflict. Even though it is a linear narrative but its extreme ending encourage the audiences to think about a possible worlds and possible answer for this kind of conflict as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-348" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 2.49.44 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM-1024x214.png" width="478" height="100" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM-1024x214.png 1024w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM.png 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Norman McLaren’s Neighbours (1952)</em></p>
<p> As a tribute, I’m thinking of borrowing a form of houses used in the film to our game because the juxtaposition of two sides is a narrative technique that we will emphasize in our game as well.</p>
<p>In this week, we are also developing a new item that would go into the game, the one that Paul really passionate about, a water gun.</p>
<p>The playable prototype explores common possible events such as bullet/enemy collision detection, bullet-regenerating point, and enemies re spawn. We also discussed on possible controlling scheme for the game, as many people including Colleen tends to have strong opinion on ‘ virtual buttons’ in touchscreen interface as a counter-intuitive control. Zach Gage also mentioned on his talk at GDC last year as a bad scheme that won’t allow the player to achieve flow in the game.</p>
<p>We tested the swiping interaction in the game instead of the use of button but have yet to satisfy with current algorithm that we have, as it have a really buggy movement. Paul suggested that we should go back to buttons scheme, but I’m still thinking that there might be a way to get this interaction right.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-350" alt="watergun2" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg" width="436" height="232" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2-300x160.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></a></p>
<p>We had a chance to play demo of Worm Run, a game by Andy Wallace, alumni of MFADT, during Playtech event in December. In the game, it has a very interesting relationship between the control scheme and aesthetic of the game. As Andy called it as ‘swipe to survive’, in which the player basically swipe in every direction as fast as possible to run away from a giant worm that hunting you for a lunch.</p>
<p>I suspected that different opinions on controlling scheme might means that we also aiming for a slightly different aesthetic goal of a game. However, I think it is a healthy argument and I think we’ll explore more on until we find the right algorithm before really fallback to the button control scheme.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this first week, Colleen had to attended the conference she promised to go. So we had this chance of a week without pressure (well, or just without realizing that pressure). We decided to stay away from code for a bit longer and started to make a boardgame version of our game. Which largely inspired by Lord of The Ring that we played together.</p>
<p><strong>First prototype</strong>, orange pieces are our attempt on exploring terrain system in boardgame version. Blue pieces are challenge system that would trigger by chance. This system is to balance out between time to spend on exploring the terrain also triggering chance of things getting worse. Lastly, green board is main progress board. Each stage can have different progress and goal.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-219" alt="paper prototype 1" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-768x1024.jpg" width="553" height="737" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-225x300.jpg 225w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Second prototype</strong>, we explore more on how terrain can provide both linear narrative and randomness. The orange tiles are randomly place on the fixed terrain of each stage. On each tile is a different kind of stuffs: treasure, adventure, pass, and challenge.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-220" alt="2" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-1024x768.jpg" width="542" height="407" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SCN_0007.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-223" alt="SCN_0007" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SCN_0007-1024x426.jpg" width="574" height="238" /></a> <a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-224" alt="tiletype" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-1024x320.jpg" width="574" height="179" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-300x93.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-1024x320.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Third prototype</strong>, we expanded those idea of each tile type into set of cards (most of them just a placeholder though.) Challenge card is not on terrain anymore but is randomly pick at the beginning of the turn from movement tile. There is a chance to just move normally (-) and facing challenge (x). While adventure, treasure and pass are still on terrain. The terrain are revealed while the player is on adjacent tile. So that the player still have a chance to make a meaningful choice from their line of sight.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-221" alt="3" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Fourth prototype</strong>, we started to go into adventure tile and treasure tile. Some of  adventure tile has a chance of getting treasure but will have to fight against something for example fighting with a monster through simple die roll. While some are just a fight without direct consequence to the main story. On the other hand, treasure cards can be picked right away. And usually required or helpful for clearing adventure card.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/4.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-222" alt="4" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/4-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of the week, we had a brunch and update presentation at d12. John and Colleen stop us very early when we started to explain the detail of rule of card game. It was a really rabbit hole. John quickly suggest that paper prototype is fine, but focus on just one medium. Games are not translate across medium as easy as we thought.</p>
<p>However, it was a great sidetrack. We had a tons of idea for side system and world making of the game. So here we go again, back to the core mechanic, coming up soon!</p>
<p>PS. Ultimate goal of this semester, FIVE STAGES!</p>
