				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this first week, Colleen had to attended the conference she promised to go. So we had this chance of a week without pressure (well, or just without realizing that pressure). We decided to stay away from code for a bit longer and started to make a boardgame version of our game. Which largely inspired by Lord of The Ring that we played together.</p>
<p><strong>First prototype</strong>, orange pieces are our attempt on exploring terrain system in boardgame version. Blue pieces are challenge system that would trigger by chance. This system is to balance out between time to spend on exploring the terrain also triggering chance of things getting worse. Lastly, green board is main progress board. Each stage can have different progress and goal.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-219" alt="paper prototype 1" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-768x1024.jpg" width="553" height="737" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-225x300.jpg 225w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Second prototype</strong>, we explore more on how terrain can provide both linear narrative and randomness. The orange tiles are randomly place on the fixed terrain of each stage. On each tile is a different kind of stuffs: treasure, adventure, pass, and challenge.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-220" alt="2" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-1024x768.jpg" width="542" height="407" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SCN_0007.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-223" alt="SCN_0007" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SCN_0007-1024x426.jpg" width="574" height="238" /></a> <a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-224" alt="tiletype" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-1024x320.jpg" width="574" height="179" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-300x93.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tiletype-1024x320.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Third prototype</strong>, we expanded those idea of each tile type into set of cards (most of them just a placeholder though.) Challenge card is not on terrain anymore but is randomly pick at the beginning of the turn from movement tile. There is a chance to just move normally (-) and facing challenge (x). While adventure, treasure and pass are still on terrain. The terrain are revealed while the player is on adjacent tile. So that the player still have a chance to make a meaningful choice from their line of sight.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth prototype</strong>, we started to go into adventure tile and treasure tile. Some of Â adventure tile has a chance of getting treasure but will have to fight against something for example fighting with a monster through simple die roll. While some are just a fight without direct consequence to the main story. On the other hand, treasure cards can be picked right away. And usually required or helpful for clearing adventure card.</p>

<p>At the end of the week, we had a brunch and update presentation at d12. John and Colleen stop us very early when we started to explain the detail of rule of card game. It was a really rabbit hole. John quickly suggest that paper prototype is fine, but focus on just one medium. Games are not translate across medium as easy as we thought.</p>
<p>However, it was a great sidetrack. We had a tons of idea for side system and world making of the game. So here we go again, back to the core mechanic, coming up soon!</p>
<p>PS. Ultimate goal of this semester, FIVE STAGES!</p>
