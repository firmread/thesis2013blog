				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Collaboratively working on code is one of the trickiest parts of our workflow.</p>
<p>This week Colleen asked us to make a schedule for the whole semester so that we can keep record and see if we’re on track of making things finished as it meant to be or not.</p>
<p>With these two reasons, I think it crucial for us to use Github as tool that will provide us a environment that let us keep track of both production timeline and versioning of the code. It took a while to setup the repository and list all the production needs into a list for each week. Hopefully, this process will not helpful for the project afterward.</p>
<p>While not widely used as a social network, it is a significant platform that moves the open source community that collaboratively develops emerging frameworks that empowering people all over the world such as OpenFrameworks or NodeJS. Developing literacy for this platform also means that we are preparing ourselves for potential bigger contributions in the future.</p>

<p>The following pictures are part of a film Zach Lieberman showed to us in Audio/Video System class, Neighbours by Norman McLaren. I personally love the aesthetic of old media. It is a stop-motion film that also has a playful sense of animation and talk to more serious relationship between border and neighborhood.</p>
<p>The film started by two neighbors living peacefully in shared space until there is a beautiful flower grown in the middle of their house. After just a few moments of enjoyment that they both shared, they start to fight for ownership over the flower. I like how the story takes us through the worst narrative route you could possibly have in this kind of conflict. Even though it is a linear narrative but its extreme ending encourage the audiences to think about a possible worlds and possible answer for this kind of conflict as well.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Norman McLaren’s Neighbours (1952)</em></p>
<p> As a tribute, I’m thinking of borrowing a form of houses used in the film to our game because the juxtaposition of two sides is a narrative technique that we will emphasize in our game as well.</p>
<p>In this week, we are also developing a new item that would go into the game, the one that Paul really passionate about, a water gun.</p>
<p>The playable prototype explores common possible events such as bullet/enemy collision detection, bullet-regenerating point, and enemies re spawn. We also discussed on possible controlling scheme for the game, as many people including Colleen tends to have strong opinion on ‘ virtual buttons’ in touchscreen interface as a counter-intuitive control. Zach Gage also mentioned on his talk at GDC last year as a bad scheme that won’t allow the player to achieve flow in the game.</p>
<p>We tested the swiping interaction in the game instead of the use of button but have yet to satisfy with current algorithm that we have, as it have a really buggy movement. Paul suggested that we should go back to buttons scheme, but I’m still thinking that there might be a way to get this interaction right.</p>

<p>We had a chance to play demo of Worm Run, a game by Andy Wallace, alumni of MFADT, during Playtech event in December. In the game, it has a very interesting relationship between the control scheme and aesthetic of the game. As Andy called it as ‘swipe to survive’, in which the player basically swipe in every direction as fast as possible to run away from a giant worm that hunting you for a lunch.</p>
<p>I suspected that different opinions on controlling scheme might means that we also aiming for a slightly different aesthetic goal of a game. However, I think it is a healthy argument and I think we’ll explore more on until we find the right algorithm before really fallback to the button control scheme.</p>
