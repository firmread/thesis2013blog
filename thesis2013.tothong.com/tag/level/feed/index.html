				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week we started to realize a very complicated design problems in our game concept. Since the game is about two players simultaneously play the game on both side of the iPad. There are so many ways to write this in code.</p>
<p>Zach Lieberman introduced us with the concept of inheritance in C++ in Algorithmic Animation class last semester. It is a very powerful concept in this language that allowed us to create variations of object in the world by start with the base object that with a vague explanation but contains all property needed for the type of the object. There is a saying that the code would get too complex to the point where is human unreadable in lower level, original C at somewhere around 25,000 lines of code. While with this concept of object-oriented language in C++, that point of unreadable would somewhere around 100,000 lines of code.</p>
<p>As we are trying to master this new logic of object-oriented into our project. It is a really hard design question as we trying to make a base game mechanic that would be able to expand into a whole game.</p>
<p>thatThey is really consisted of two worlds, not just in narrative level but also on the coding side. We are using Box2d, physic simulations library for two-dimensional game and in Box2d we have to initiate the object that is called as box2dWorld that would contains universal properties for every objects that is inside that world, such as gravity and damping.</p>
<p>We tried to organize the two-world logic of our game by making an object of one world and then call two of them out in a gameplay so that we can get the two-world game. While theoretically sounds, we found a lot of problem in making this logic comes true because we are also trying to translate the code from our last prototype from last semester into this new foundation that we can use moving further.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we also making sketches for level design. These sketches are heavily inspired by the game ’Guacamelee!’ by DrinkBox Studios that we played together in IndieCade East. Since the game is also two-player collaborative platformer game and we feels good playing it. So we aim to making a similar demo that shows an introductory level of game’s various mechanic and just a small bit if narrative that could potentially expand into a bigger game later.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that we have a lot of unexpected reaction from Colleen and IndieCade East folks that came to our class in the following Tuesday after the event including Rami Ismail, one of the creator of the game Super Crate Box, Fernando Ramallo from Buenos Aires, and Davey Wreden, developer of an interactive narrative game, Stanley Parable. They all have a strong reaction on how our game is going in a wrong direction as we put more ‘stuffs’ into the core mechanic. They provide us with the same suggestions on we should develop on only one strong core mechanic and expand that into a whole game.</p>
<p>While very different from what we thought, we also learnt a lot from a resource that these guys point us to such as Anna Anthropy’s article named: ‘level design lesson: to the right, hold on tight.’ Which explained in detail on the first level of the first Super Mario Bros. in NES about how this level design has become so iconic that it impress the whole generation of the gamer. The article entailed about how good level design can just provide affordance of discovery for the player inside the game without having to provide a traditional tutorial to a player.</p>

<p>The subject explored in more detail in online video show called Sequelitis that talked about the norm in Mega Man and how the first level of Mega Man X a sequel in SNES is designed to inform the player about new system of the game without having to explain any details. Which at the same time, wrap the whole game’s narrative very well in one scene that provides a simple aesthetic goal and motivation for the player that will recur throughout the game: to make Mega Man stronger.</p>
