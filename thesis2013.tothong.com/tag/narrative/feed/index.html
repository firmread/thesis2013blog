				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we focused on how narrative layers intersect with level design by focusing on non-player characters that will appear in game, and how the story should progress.</p>
<p>The idea is the world inside thatThey is a dreamscape. Memories are misplaced, some are lost, and some are exaggerated. The character such as dog, birds, or rabbit can be a representation of friends inside the classroom and the boss of the game, dog’s mother; can be an angry parent of a bullyboy that represented as a dog.  Birds are like a bunch of smaller bullies these kids have to face. It is hard even just to hold on to oneself under this kind of situation but in some situation someone needs to stand up and help those are in needed. The choice would fall to the player if they would want to score on their personal safety or collaboratively protect each other.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The narrative concept for thesis project, an iPad game with working title ‘thatThey’, is inspired by my experience back in Thailand during my undergrad years where I went to rural northern part of Thailand with my faculty’s voluntary camp.</p>
<p>It was a great experience for me. I went to about seven voluntary camps throughout my undergrad years. The goal of the camp is to build a small concrete building for local school that doesn’t have enough funding from government. On the other hand, it also allows student that born and raised in big city like myself to experience life without technologies in those rural areas where the moon is still the brightest source of light at night.</p>
<p>I met Sarun in the last camp I attended.</p>
<p>Here is a translation of the blog post I wrote for Sarun a few months after the camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><i>Original Thai version: </i><a href="http://litchirhythm.multiply.com/journal/item/8/8"><i>http://litchirhythm.multiply.com/journal/item/8/8</i></a><i></i></p>
<p align="right"><b>SAI-YAI  </b>(Thai for: string, relationship)</p>
<p>Theory is<br />
When people start to know each other,<br />
Develop their feeling for each other,<br />
String of our soul,<br />
Also tied to one another’s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back of the truck, that carried about thirty college students back into the city from a small school in a rural uphill.<br />
Picture of Sarun still imprint vividly in the mind of a seventh-time camper,<br />
It was about a year and a half since his last voluntary camp.<br />
This feeling that he once used to, once again, fresh in the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First picture is slowly packing a bag<br />
Fold down a tent house<br />
A small school that we live as if it was our home is now transform back to what it meant to be.<br />
Then we take everything that we brought back, except those that meant to be given, into the truck<br />
Just a few souvenirs in each of our hand,<br />
And memories.<br />
Sarun like to hold my hand<br />
Sarun is the first camp kid that ever draws a picture of him to my notebook<br />
Sarun is the only camp kid that asked me to jump down into a river with him</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day before the last day Sarun didn’t show up at the school<br />
I was worried that we might don’t have a chance to say goodbye</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last morning, Sarun was back and hold my hand again<br />
“Where were you yesterday?”</p>
<p>“I was helping my dad herding”</p>
<p>“Umm”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This second grade boy was much better at digging than some of the second year college student<br />
It wouldn’t surprise me at all if his herding skill is also superior than this fifth year college student too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belongings slowly put into their containers<br />
Trucks came in and take all students and those containers back to the town</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last picture was from the back of the truck with a tensile roof<br />
It covered the truck in the way that make picture of the scenery behind appears to be so bright<br />
Waving hands<br />
All the camp kids were there<br />
And indeed, Sarun too</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck turn around the corner to the main street<br />
Picture of those classrooms vanished from my eyes<br />
A boy then ran out from that corner<br />
And wave his hand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trucks slowly run through a crooked street</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question is: how much distance would it takes before this this string torn apart<br />
I imagined my soul get thinner and thinner as the truck goes on<br />
Strings spun themselves out as the distance increase<br />
And when it ran out of any more soul to spun, it started to stretch like a rubber<br />
And it gets thinner and thinner<br />
Until it torn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be right at that moment that the string that tied us together, is gone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I wake up<br />
As the cloud of dreams dissipated and the sun shine through my window again<br />
I found myself hold on a small string inside my memories<br />
Piece of the story that haven’t been forgotten</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at it, thoroughly, once again<br />
And decided to tell you, this story.</p>
