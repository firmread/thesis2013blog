				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week we started to realize a very complicated design problems in our game concept. Since the game is about two players simultaneously play the game on both side of the iPad. There are so many ways to write this in code.</p>
<p>Zach Lieberman introduced us with the concept of inheritance in C++ in Algorithmic Animation class last semester. It is a very powerful concept in this language that allowed us to create variations of object in the world by start with the base object that with a vague explanation but contains all property needed for the type of the object. There is a saying that the code would get too complex to the point where is human unreadable in lower level, original C at somewhere around 25,000 lines of code. While with this concept of object-oriented language in C++, that point of unreadable would somewhere around 100,000 lines of code.</p>
<p>As we are trying to master this new logic of object-oriented into our project. It is a really hard design question as we trying to make a base game mechanic that would be able to expand into a whole game.</p>
<p>thatThey is really consisted of two worlds, not just in narrative level but also on the coding side. We are using Box2d, physic simulations library for two-dimensional game and in Box2d we have to initiate the object that is called as box2dWorld that would contains universal properties for every objects that is inside that world, such as gravity and damping.</p>
<p>We tried to organize the two-world logic of our game by making an object of one world and then call two of them out in a gameplay so that we can get the two-world game. While theoretically sounds, we found a lot of problem in making this logic comes true because we are also trying to translate the code from our last prototype from last semester into this new foundation that we can use moving further.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we also making sketches for level design. These sketches are heavily inspired by the game ’Guacamelee!’ by DrinkBox Studios that we played together in IndieCade East. Since the game is also two-player collaborative platformer game and we feels good playing it. So we aim to making a similar demo that shows an introductory level of game’s various mechanic and just a small bit if narrative that could potentially expand into a bigger game later.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that we have a lot of unexpected reaction from Colleen and IndieCade East folks that came to our class in the following Tuesday after the event including Rami Ismail, one of the creator of the game Super Crate Box, Fernando Ramallo from Buenos Aires, and Davey Wreden, developer of an interactive narrative game, Stanley Parable. They all have a strong reaction on how our game is going in a wrong direction as we put more ‘stuffs’ into the core mechanic. They provide us with the same suggestions on we should develop on only one strong core mechanic and expand that into a whole game.</p>
<p>While very different from what we thought, we also learnt a lot from a resource that these guys point us to such as Anna Anthropy’s article named: ‘level design lesson: to the right, hold on tight.’ Which explained in detail on the first level of the first Super Mario Bros. in NES about how this level design has become so iconic that it impress the whole generation of the gamer. The article entailed about how good level design can just provide affordance of discovery for the player inside the game without having to provide a traditional tutorial to a player.</p>

<p>The subject explored in more detail in online video show called Sequelitis that talked about the norm in Mega Man and how the first level of Mega Man X a sequel in SNES is designed to inform the player about new system of the game without having to explain any details. Which at the same time, wrap the whole game’s narrative very well in one scene that provides a simple aesthetic goal and motivation for the player that will recur throughout the game: to make Mega Man stronger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Collaboratively working on code is one of the trickiest parts of our workflow.</p>
<p>This week Colleen asked us to make a schedule for the whole semester so that we can keep record and see if we’re on track of making things finished as it meant to be or not.</p>
<p>With these two reasons, I think it crucial for us to use Github as tool that will provide us a environment that let us keep track of both production timeline and versioning of the code. It took a while to setup the repository and list all the production needs into a list for each week. Hopefully, this process will not helpful for the project afterward.</p>
<p>While not widely used as a social network, it is a significant platform that moves the open source community that collaboratively develops emerging frameworks that empowering people all over the world such as OpenFrameworks or NodeJS. Developing literacy for this platform also means that we are preparing ourselves for potential bigger contributions in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following pictures are part of a film Zach Lieberman showed to us in Audio/Video System class, Neighbours by Norman McLaren. I personally love the aesthetic of old media. It is a stop-motion film that also has a playful sense of animation and talk to more serious relationship between border and neighborhood.</p>
<p>The film started by two neighbors living peacefully in shared space until there is a beautiful flower grown in the middle of their house. After just a few moments of enjoyment that they both shared, they start to fight for ownership over the flower. I like how the story takes us through the worst narrative route you could possibly have in this kind of conflict. Even though it is a linear narrative but its extreme ending encourage the audiences to think about a possible worlds and possible answer for this kind of conflict as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-348" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 2.49.44 AM" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM-1024x214.png" width="478" height="100" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM-1024x214.png 1024w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-04-08-at-2.49.44-AM.png 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Norman McLaren’s Neighbours (1952)</em></p>
<p> As a tribute, I’m thinking of borrowing a form of houses used in the film to our game because the juxtaposition of two sides is a narrative technique that we will emphasize in our game as well.</p>
<p>In this week, we are also developing a new item that would go into the game, the one that Paul really passionate about, a water gun.</p>
<p>The playable prototype explores common possible events such as bullet/enemy collision detection, bullet-regenerating point, and enemies re spawn. We also discussed on possible controlling scheme for the game, as many people including Colleen tends to have strong opinion on ‘ virtual buttons’ in touchscreen interface as a counter-intuitive control. Zach Gage also mentioned on his talk at GDC last year as a bad scheme that won’t allow the player to achieve flow in the game.</p>
<p>We tested the swiping interaction in the game instead of the use of button but have yet to satisfy with current algorithm that we have, as it have a really buggy movement. Paul suggested that we should go back to buttons scheme, but I’m still thinking that there might be a way to get this interaction right.</p>
<p><a href="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-350" alt="watergun2" src="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg" width="436" height="232" srcset="http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2-300x160.jpg 300w, http://thesis2013.tothong.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watergun2.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></a></p>
<p>We had a chance to play demo of Worm Run, a game by Andy Wallace, alumni of MFADT, during Playtech event in December. In the game, it has a very interesting relationship between the control scheme and aesthetic of the game. As Andy called it as ‘swipe to survive’, in which the player basically swipe in every direction as fast as possible to run away from a giant worm that hunting you for a lunch.</p>
<p>I suspected that different opinions on controlling scheme might means that we also aiming for a slightly different aesthetic goal of a game. However, I think it is a healthy argument and I think we’ll explore more on until we find the right algorithm before really fallback to the button control scheme.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The narrative concept for thesis project, an iPad game with working title ‘thatThey’, is inspired by my experience back in Thailand during my undergrad years where I went to rural northern part of Thailand with my faculty’s voluntary camp.</p>
<p>It was a great experience for me. I went to about seven voluntary camps throughout my undergrad years. The goal of the camp is to build a small concrete building for local school that doesn’t have enough funding from government. On the other hand, it also allows student that born and raised in big city like myself to experience life without technologies in those rural areas where the moon is still the brightest source of light at night.</p>
<p>I met Sarun in the last camp I attended.</p>
<p>Here is a translation of the blog post I wrote for Sarun a few months after the camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><i>Original Thai version: </i><a href="http://litchirhythm.multiply.com/journal/item/8/8"><i>http://litchirhythm.multiply.com/journal/item/8/8</i></a><i></i></p>
<p align="right"><b>SAI-YAI  </b>(Thai for: string, relationship)</p>
<p>Theory is<br />
When people start to know each other,<br />
Develop their feeling for each other,<br />
String of our soul,<br />
Also tied to one another’s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the back of the truck, that carried about thirty college students back into the city from a small school in a rural uphill.<br />
Picture of Sarun still imprint vividly in the mind of a seventh-time camper,<br />
It was about a year and a half since his last voluntary camp.<br />
This feeling that he once used to, once again, fresh in the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First picture is slowly packing a bag<br />
Fold down a tent house<br />
A small school that we live as if it was our home is now transform back to what it meant to be.<br />
Then we take everything that we brought back, except those that meant to be given, into the truck<br />
Just a few souvenirs in each of our hand,<br />
And memories.<br />
Sarun like to hold my hand<br />
Sarun is the first camp kid that ever draws a picture of him to my notebook<br />
Sarun is the only camp kid that asked me to jump down into a river with him</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day before the last day Sarun didn’t show up at the school<br />
I was worried that we might don’t have a chance to say goodbye</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last morning, Sarun was back and hold my hand again<br />
“Where were you yesterday?”</p>
<p>“I was helping my dad herding”</p>
<p>“Umm”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This second grade boy was much better at digging than some of the second year college student<br />
It wouldn’t surprise me at all if his herding skill is also superior than this fifth year college student too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belongings slowly put into their containers<br />
Trucks came in and take all students and those containers back to the town</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last picture was from the back of the truck with a tensile roof<br />
It covered the truck in the way that make picture of the scenery behind appears to be so bright<br />
Waving hands<br />
All the camp kids were there<br />
And indeed, Sarun too</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck turn around the corner to the main street<br />
Picture of those classrooms vanished from my eyes<br />
A boy then ran out from that corner<br />
And wave his hand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trucks slowly run through a crooked street</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question is: how much distance would it takes before this this string torn apart<br />
I imagined my soul get thinner and thinner as the truck goes on<br />
Strings spun themselves out as the distance increase<br />
And when it ran out of any more soul to spun, it started to stretch like a rubber<br />
And it gets thinner and thinner<br />
Until it torn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be right at that moment that the string that tied us together, is gone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I wake up<br />
As the cloud of dreams dissipated and the sun shine through my window again<br />
I found myself hold on a small string inside my memories<br />
Piece of the story that haven’t been forgotten</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at it, thoroughly, once again<br />
And decided to tell you, this story.</p>
