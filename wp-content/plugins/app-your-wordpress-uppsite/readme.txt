= Why we do this? =

At UppSite we believe that web publishers (and by that we mean anyone with a website) deserve the best mobile presence. Why? Because we also believe that consuming web content on mobile devices should be effortless and engaging.

Mobile has significantly changed how people consume content these days. More and more we attempt to access and consume content from our mobile devices (whether smartphones, such as iPhone or an Android device, or tablets, such as iPad). However, mobile is a new form factor and users expect to enjoy seamless experiences extending the functionality and UI design that is characteristic to their devices. Shrinking websites to fit a mobile screen is simply not enough. In the mobile era publishers and content creators should, so we believe, engage with their audiences in a mobile way.

True, going mobile is normally a tedious task that requires significant investments and dealings with many outlets and providers to get your app out on the market. Gladly, this is not the case with UppSite. We’ve set out to bridge the mobile gap for all publishers by providing a dead-simple and fast solution to turn a site into a mobile application, without compromising the quality of the end result. From creation and publication to maintenance and upgrades we make this process as easy as it gets, and as affordable as you could only imagine. Our apps (native & webapp), although created in a matter minutes deliver all the features and functionality that you’d expect from the most cutting-edge apps out there, and cater to the needs of publishers of all sizes.

= I installed the plugin, activated it and nothing happens? =
After you activate the plugin, please go to the "Mobile" tab under "Settings" in your wp-admin to configure your mobile apps. Only after you finish the basic configuration you will be able to publish your mobile apps.

= Can I customize the way my mobile app looks like? =

= Can I change my app's name? =
Yes! As long as this name is not being used by any other user on our service, you can change your app's name via the Mobile tab in your wp-admin.

Please note that if you already have a native app with our service, then the name of your app cannot be changed again as stipulated by the terms and conditions governing Apple’s App Store, Google Play and Windows Marketplace.

= How much does it cost to use UppSite? =
It's easy to get started with UppSite for free and make your site mobile for your mobile web visitors (full HTML5 app). We also have premium plans that give you more control over branding and customization of your apps, as well as more powerful features to engage with your mobile audience and monetize your content.

= How do I publish my mobile app on Apple's App Store, Google Play or Windows Marketplace? =
Well, we do it for you! UppSite automatically create native mobile apps for you. To ask that we submit your native mobile apps to the various app stores, please go to the App Stores tab in your Mobile dashboard and follow the instructions there. Please note: Publishing native apps requires that you license a developer account from Apple, Google and Microsoft respectively. We will not be bale to submit apps on your behalf to a store without a valid developer account.

= Why do I need apps for various devices? =
Different mobile devices run on different operating systems and provide different user experiences. That's why a different native mobile app is required for each mobile platform. For example, Apple's iPhone and iPad run on iOS, while many Samsung, HTC, LG and Motorola devices run on Android. In order to reach a large audience, apps must be created for a wide range of devices and, therefore, for different operating systems. On top of that, our HTML5 apps will work on any mobile web browser across platforms.
